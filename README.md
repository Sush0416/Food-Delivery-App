## Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:  
- Node.js (v12.x or later)  
- npm or yarn  
- MongoDB (local or remote instance)  
- Git  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sush0416/Food-Delivery-App.git
   cd Food-Delivery-App
````

2. Install dependencies for **server** and **client** (if separate)

   ```bash
   # In root or server folder
   npm install

   # In client folder
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the server folder with required variables, e.g.:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
   ```

### Running the App

* For development mode

  ```bash
  # Start backend
  npm run dev    # or node server/index.js

  # Start frontend
  cd client
  npm start
  ```

* Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port) in your browser to use the app.

* For production build (frontend)

  ```bash
  cd client
  npm run build
  ```

  Then serve the `build` folder via your backend or a static host.
